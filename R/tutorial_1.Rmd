## Assignment

### 1) Create a practice project

Create a project in your `U:/` drive that we can use throughout these tutorials. This project should include:

#### 1a) Git

- Initiate Git, make some test commits and get a feel for using git in a project.   
- Create a repository on Gitlab and link this project to that repository.   

#### 1b) Package structure

- Create a `DESCRIPTION` file
- Create a practice script to test `devtools::load_all()`, as well as roxygen2 documentation using `devtools::document()`
- Feel free to continue to play around with other features discussed in the package chapter

### 2) Readings

- [Chapter 3: Shiny](https://b-klaver.github.io/shinyWorkflows/shiny.html)
