# Shiny Workflows Tutorials

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The shiny workflows tutorials are meant to accompany the [Shiny
Workflows](https://b-klaver.github.io/shinyWorkflows/) bookdown document
to help guide you through developing your first shiny app using the best
practices as described by POSIT.

The four tutorials will introduce tools such as git and package
development, as well as app building using shiny, bslib, and
modularization. At the end you should have a fully functioning shiny app
that is version controlled, built using package-app structure, designed
using bslib, with modularized shiny components.
