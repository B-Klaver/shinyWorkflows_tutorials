# Shiny Workflows Tutorials

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The shiny workflows tutorials are meant to accompany the [Shiny Workflows](https://b-klaver.github.io/shinyWorkflows/) bookdown document to help guide you through developing your first shiny app using the best practices as described by POSIT. 

The four tutorials will introduce tools such as git and package development, as well as app building using shiny, bslib, and modularization. At the end you should have a fully functioning shiny app that is version controlled, built using package-app structure, designed using bslib, with modularized shiny components.
